Change Management is a feature of Organizations that enables role-based permissions for users in the Organization. Sites which list the Organization as a supporting Organization are accessible to privileged members of the Organization. The roles exist to restrict who can deploy and manage other users in the Organization or sites it works on.

## Features and Benefits
* Enterprise Organizations with Change Management can add people as Team Members and Developers to sites.
* When an Organization is added to a site as a supporting Organization (e.g. Agencies), the members and roles of the Organization are inherited for working on the site. All Organization members can access all sites associated with the organization.
* Agencies added to Sites by subscription owners are able to use Change Management internally, but the subscription owners are notâ€”they can only add full team members.
* All users in an Organization can see other users and their roles.

### Supporting Organizations
One of the best things about Pantheon is the ability to collaborate with agencies and shops on web projects. If you have contracted with a Pantheon Partner or Ally Agency, you can add them to the site as a _supporting organization_, which will give their company access to help build, launch, or maintain your site.  

1. Click **Team** in the upper-right of the Site Dashboard.
2. Click **Add Supporting Organization** at the bottom of the team management window.
3. Enter the complete name of the agency. An exact match is required.
4. Check that the agency is the one you expected.
5. Click the **Add Agency** button to make them a supporting organization.

## Roles and Permissions

### Team Member
Team Members are a trusted role that can make changes to the Test and Live environments, add and edit other team members, and add supporting Organizations.

### Developer
Developers can only work on the Development environment, and cannot deploy to Test or Live.
